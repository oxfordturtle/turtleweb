    <p>Your students can submit Turtle programs to your assignments, which you can then download or run directly in your browser. In order to make the latter possible, the programs must be submitted in the precompiled format. Instead of saving the program file normally, your students will have to run 'File > Export program / metadata file...' in the downloadable Turtle System. This exported file includes the program code, the compiled executable code, and also some automatically generated commands usage data (available under the 'Usage' tab of the Turtle System). If you design your assignments accordingly (e.g. telling your students to use a certain number of commands of particular types), this usage data can then greatly simplify your marking&mdash;by taking care of the mundane tasks for you, thereby freeing you to focus on programming style and overall quality.</p>
