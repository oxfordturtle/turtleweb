      <p>This web site collects some personal data when you register (name, email address, school, and date of birth and home postcode for students). It also collects general usage data. These data are stored on a web server in the Computer Science Department at the University of Oxford, and will be retained until you delete your account (you can delete your account at any time). We will process the data in a proper manner, and take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to it, and any disclosure, modification, or destruction of it.</p>
      <p>The personal and usage data will be used solely for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul class="bullet list">
        <li>Automatically authenticating user login requests.</li>
        <li>Performing additional automated security tests in the event that a user forgets his or her login credentials.</li>
        <li>Automatically monitoring the usage of the site, in order to improve the quality of the service.</li>
        <li>Manually looking up school and contact details for teachers, with a view to contacting them for mutual benefit (discussing how this service might be improved, offering training sessions, school vists, etc.).</li>
        <li>At some future point, we may wish to use students' postcodes and dates of birth in order to measure the impact of this project, for the purposes of assessing and improving outreach work at the University of Oxford. In such a case, the data will be anonymised and processed automatically.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By signing up to this site, you agree that we may use your data in these ways. If this policy changes in the future, we will email you informing you of the changes, at which point you may choose to delete your account; not doing so will be taken as consenting to the changes.</p>
