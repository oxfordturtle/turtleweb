        <p>Welcome to the Turtle Forum. This section of the site is divided into two sections: <a href="{{ path('student_courses') }}">Courses</a> and <a href="{{ path('student_files') }}">Files</a>. In the former you can join your teacher's courses (your teacher will give you a passcode to sign up), and then view the course materials and submit work for your assignments. In the latter you can upload and view any Turtle programs you have written. Uploaded programs can be submitted as part of your courses, or just stored in your personal folder on this site.</p>
        <p>When you are logged in to the site, all of your uploaded programs will be shown in an extra menu in the 'File' tab of the <a href="{{ path('online_home') }}">Online Turtle System</a>. Any programs you upload can be run directly in a web browser, and accessed wherever you have an internet connection.</p>
